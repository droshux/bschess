  <h1>Bullsh*t Chess:</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      BS-Chess is a "simple" game, chess but you can do <strong>literally anything </strong>
      you want, the only thing stopping you from instantly winning is the
      fact that your opponent has <strong>veto power</strong>. So to win you
      have to justify your "bullsh*ts" well, sacrifice pieces to summon stronger
      custom pieces and most importantly: think on your feet.
